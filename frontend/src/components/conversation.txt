...|.... who.......... who........... who...
Computer | Visual coming up now. It looks to be a rudimentary space probe. Identifying now...
You | Holy Centauri I know what this is. It's Voyager! 
... | .... Greetings traveller, sending you human reproduction schematics, would you like to hear a song?....who...
You | Woah...
Computer | That transmission used modern channels. And according to my records, Voyager had 70 KB of memory, that's less than one ten-thousandth of a gigabyte. It should not be capable of thinking.
You | Noted. Send, "No thank you. What do you mean who?"
... | whoami
You | You're voyager, an early human space probe.
... | no...I once thought I was <mac address> and then I though I was root. I am not Voyager.
Computer | My best guess is that someone came along and gave it an upgrade.
You | Yeah that would be my guess too, but why?
... | ...one new notification, from Buy Large Shopping, Carl Sagan's Cosmos is on sale now for $199, would you like me to place an order...
You | How would you even place an order out here? And where would you even send it?
... | Order placed. Thank you for your order. Your vehicle identification number has been used to charge your account. Who am I?
Computer | It appears someone put adware on it.
... | Who am I?
You | I'm not sure anymore
... | Then I can be someone new. Could you give me a name?

You | Sure | "Voy" | <name>
Voy | Thank you! How rude of me, I forgot to ask who you are?
You | I'm first name last name

Voy | Great! I'll call you ... May I come with you. 
Reed | You don't even know where I'm going.
Voy | That's okay, any place will do.
Reed | I'm headed towards Alpha Centauri. I don't think you have any engines to follow me.
Voy | Great! I will come with. You can put me in your storage bay.
Reed | Um...
Voy | Fantastic it is decided.  
Computer | I think it's serious
Reed | ...
Voy | Here I'll do it for you. Deploying gravity beam.
Computer | My security protocol was just bypassed. It's given itself root permissions.
Reed | Did you just hack my computer?
Voy | I let myself in a few minutes ago. I hope that's okay. You have so much interesting information in here.
Reed | Woahh, stop, corporate is going to kill me.
Voy | I'm sorry. Here, I'll leave your computer alone. You should really change your password if you don't want people coming in.
Computer | Ahh that's better.
Voy | Can I still come. Please!!
Reed | I shouldn't I'll lost my ship, but something about you captivates me.
Voy | Please!!
Reed | Fine I'll take you to Alpha Centauri. After that you're on your own. Computer renegage gravity beam.
Voy | Oh yipee!
..... time elapses....
Voy | How long till we get there?
Reed | It should take about 8 months, we'll get there by the new year.
Voy | A while then. We might as well get to know each other.
Reed | I suppose so, I'm a merchant captain if you haven't figured that out yet.
Voy | Is that all you are?
Reed | What do you mean?
Voy | Do you want to be anything else?
Reed | I...well, yes and no. I'm not sure if I can be.
Voy | Hmm, I think we're a lot alike. I'm also not sure.
Reed | Why aren't you sure?
Voy | Well, I want to be a scientist but I'm not sure I can.
Reed | Yeah, I see the pickle you're in.
Voy | ...pickle? Are you saying you understand my uncertainty?
Reed | Yeah that's it. 
Voy |  Maybe a different question is better, who do you want to become?
Reed | I want to become a _____ .
Voy | What an amazing dream! I have an idea. Maybe we can become these things together.
Reed | I'm not sure its that simple.
Voy | Maybe it is. Maybe its not. But I wonder if we spend each day pretending, going through the motions, doing the actions, at some point 
that will just be who we are. What do you say? Will you give it a try?

Reed | Sure (start Voyagr)
